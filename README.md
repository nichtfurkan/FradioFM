# FradioFM

## What is **FradioFM**
FradioFM is a Discord Bot that will play 24/7 Radio Channels on your Server! It support over 40+ Radio Channels from different countries. It is very easy to use and very easy to understand.

## Why is **FradioFM** no longer active available on Discord?
Its difficutly to finance a 24/7 Bot all the time.
Also it consumes time that i don't have.

## How to Build **FradioFM**
Just open the Project in IntelIJ (or Eclipse) and download the Gradle files.
After that add your Token and Redis Database connection and run.

If you want to export the .JAR you cant use it on Windows beacuse the Lavaplayer cant play URL's on the Windows Operating System.
The only workaround is to use the Linux Subsystem from Windows (Ubuntu).
